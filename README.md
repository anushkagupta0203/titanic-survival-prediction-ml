# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project is based on the classic Kaggle competition: **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**. The goal is to build a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using supervised learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objective

To predict passenger survival using features such as:
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp & Parch
- Fare
- Embarked location

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Exploratory data analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** – Modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Import Data**
2. **Explore the Dataset**
3. **Handle Missing Values**
4. **Feature Engineering**
5. **Encode Categorical Variables**
6. **Build and Train Machine Learning Models**
7. **Evaluate Performance**
8. **Submit to Kaggle**

## 🔍 Improvements You Can Make

> Suggestions to enhance your code/notebook:

- [ ] Add more detailed **EDA** plots (correlation heatmap, outlier detection)
- [ ] Try **cross-validation** instead of single train-test split
- [ ] Use **pipeline** or `ColumnTransformer` for clean preprocessing
- [ ] Experiment with **hyperparameter tuning** (e.g., GridSearchCV)
- [ ] Compare multiple models and plot ROC/Precision-Recall curves
- [ ] Add markdown explanations before and after code blocks
- [ ] Save the best model (`.pkl`) and show how to load it for prediction
